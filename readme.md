# Purpose

I created this script during the pandemic to total all of the numbers from the different campuses at UNG. I wanted to look at the spead of distribution between the campuses, and see how they were impacted.

# How To Use

This script works in TamperMonkey, or as raw javascript at the https://ung.edu/together/managing-covid.php page.
