## The university has implemented this idea into their reporting, and has changed the structure of their data. This script's intentions are now a default inside of the UNG's website

# Purpose

I created this script during the pandemic to total all of the numbers from the different campuses at UNG. I wanted to look at the spead of distribution between the campuses, and see how they were impacted.

# How To Use

This script works exlusively on the https://ung.edu/together/managing-covid.php page. The script should be able to be used directly against the page once it's loaded.
